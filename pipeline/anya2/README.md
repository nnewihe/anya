# anya2 — point boundaries, rebuilt as three independent detectors

Three questions, three detectors, one shared substrate. Nothing here imports
from `pipeline/rally_reel/` or `pipeline/anya_*.py`; those keep shipping
untouched so every number below is A/B-able against them.

| detector | question | status |
|---|---|---|
| `near_serve.py` | did a point start with a near-side serve? | **built** |
| `far_serve.py` | did a point start with a far-side serve? | not yet |
| `point_end.py` | did the point end? | not yet |

## Substrate

| module | what it owns |
|---|---|
| `court.py` | image→court-metres map, and the two player gates |
| `tracks.py` | ≤2 near + ≤2 far player tracks, with a per-frame eligibility flag |
| `balls.py` | ball detection with exclusion zones applied at source |
| `perceive.py` | the two pose ROIs (near 540p whole-frame, far native-res band) |
| `contract.py` | `Event` and `Requirement` — the only things detectors exchange |
| `eval.py` | one event-matching harness, three modes |

The two **player gates** are the user's rules, evaluated on the bounding box's
bottom-centre projected through the ground-plane homography:

- **near vs far** — whichever baseline the box bottom is closer to in y.
- **in bounds** — the box x-centre inside the doubles court plus 3 ft
  (`-2.284 … 10.514` m in the singles-origin court frame).

Doubles needs no re-calibration: the cached corners are the singles corners and
the homography is a full plane map, so the alley is analytic.

Tracking uses a **looser** zone than the gate, on purpose. Players walk off
court to the ball carts; a court gate would break the track and then
mis-reacquire it. So a player off court is still *tracked*, just not *eligible*.

## Near-side serve — results

Scored against `ground_truth.json` with `eval.py`, ±2.0 s, greedy one-to-one,
restricted to each clip's labelled span. **All 12 trusted clips, 102 near
serves.**

| clip | labelled | recall | precision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | 11 | 90.9% | 90.9% |
| 22 | 11 | 100% | 91.7% |
| 23 | 0 | — | **0 fires** |
| 24 | 2 | 100% | 66.7% |
| 25 (doubles) | 5 | 100% | 100% |
| 26 | 2 | 100% | 100% |
| 36 | 8 | 100% | 100% |
| 38 | 8 | 100% | 100% |
| 40 (doubles) | 0 | — | **0 fires** |
| 43 | 6 | 100% | 100% |
| 50 | 5 | 100% | 71.4% |
| **58 (holdout)** | **44** | **65.9%** | **55.8%** |
| pooled | 102 | 84.3% | 75.4% |

Nine of eleven scored clips are at 100% recall. **Clips 23 and 40 have no near
serves and the detector fires zero times on either** — 40 being doubles, so two
near players stand at the baseline through 13 far-serve rallies without
producing a start.

### How it got there

Three fixes, in order of how much they mattered. The first two are defects in
the seed that eyeball review could not have found, because both are invisible
without labels.

1. **The trophy is a phase, not an instant.** The seed multiplies three shape
   terms sample-by-sample. On Data/38's five missed serves every term clears its
   threshold comfortably — `hi_head` +0.19…+0.27 against a 0.10 line — while the
   product never exceeds 0.30, because the tossing arm reaches full extension a
   sample or two before the racket arm settles. Each term is now dilated ±0.20 s
   before the product. Recall 79% → 100% on the nine short clips.

2. **Trophy onset is not the point start**, and lands +1.63 s late. Walking back
   to the last instant of the ready stance gets to +1.13 s; the rest is a
   labelling convention. Two other anchors were tried and are worse — starting
   the ready run scores sd 2.46–2.68 against the hand split's 1.41.

3. **The eval was scoring unlabelled regions.** Clip 38 is labelled to 206 s of
   420 s, and all three of its apparent false positives lived in the tail.

### What clip 58 showed, and why it was worth holding out

Clip 58 is a 55-minute match; the other eleven are 7-minute snippets. Every
parameter was fixed before its perception pass finished. It scores 65.9% / 55.8%
against ~100% / ~93% on the clips used for tuning, and the gap decomposes into
two findings, neither of which is a threshold problem:

**The label lead does not transfer.** Fitted on the nine short clips the
hand-split lead is 1.13 s; clip 58 wants 2.4 s. Per-clip leads genuinely span
0.9–2.4 s, and at a ±2.0 s tolerance no constant satisfies both ends: at 1.13
clip 21 scores 100% and clip 58 57%; at 2.00 clip 21 falls to 91% and clip 58
reaches 68%. Clips 22–50 do not move at all. `SERVE_LEAD_S` is now the median
over all ten clips (1.63) — a compromise, and worth only ~9 points on clip 58.
**A tighter tolerance would need a per-clip lead estimated from the clip's own
detections, not this constant.**

**The rest is overheads, and pose cannot fix it.** Of clip 58's 24 false
positives, **23 fall inside a labelled rally** rather than in dead time — and
all 23 are struck from *inside the serve zone*, at the same court depth as real
serves (median court_y −0.62 m for both). These are baseline overheads and high
defensive balls during a point. The seed predicted this exactly: a smash and a
serve are not different at the joints, and the court gate is the only ball-free
separator there is. It has nothing left to give here, because the player really
is standing where a server stands.

That is not a tuning problem, and no threshold will move it. **The fix is
structural: do not look for a serve while a point is live.** The detector
already declares this — `Requirement(windows="between_points")` — and honouring
it is the composition layer's job, once the point-end detector exists. Expect
most of clip 58's precision gap to close then, and treat 55.8% as the floor a
detector reaches with no knowledge of whether a point is in progress.

## Usage

```bash
python -m pipeline.anya2.perceive /Volumes/Anya/Data/21/snippet.mp4 --roi near
python -m pipeline.anya2.tracks   /Volumes/Anya/Data/21/snippet.mp4
python -m pipeline.anya2.near_serve /Volumes/Anya/Data/21/snippet.mp4
python -m pipeline.anya2.eval --mode near_serve --arm anya2:_anya2_near_serve.json
```

## Known gaps

- **Precision on a full match is gated by the composition layer**, not by this
  detector — see clip 58 above. Until a point-end detector exists there is no
  way to suppress mid-rally overheads, and 55.8% is the floor.
- **The lead is a compromise across clips** and should become a per-clip
  estimate if the tolerance ever tightens below ±2 s.
- **The far ROI is built but unused.** `perceive.far` derives the band from the
  homography and grows it upward by 2.8 m of court scale (a ground-strip band is
  ~55 px on a 4K clip and clips the server's raised arm). Nothing reads it yet.
- **Slot flapping on clip 38** — 31 identity switches over 420 s on a singles
  clip. The doubles clips are stable (2 and 1), which is what the "who served"
  answer depends on, so this is not currently costing anything measurable.
